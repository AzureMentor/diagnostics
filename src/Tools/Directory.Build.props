            We want to be able to ship pre-1.0 versions to NuGet but without
            a pre-release tag, since 'dotnet tool install -g foo' only works
            with the latest non-prerelease version (otherwise you have to specify
            an explicit version).

            So, these projects will be shipping as '0.X' versions for now.
